# about me

{{< figure src="/me.png" title="" >}}

Hi, I'm Simone Tesini, a software developer based in [Bolzano, Italy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TxdBg8ypiv83X7LC7).

I mainly like working on backend projects in Go, Python, TS/JS (node).

One language I'd really like to learn is Rust.

I'm still in school for now.

Check out my [projects](/projects)
