# My Projects

## Zigzag (working on)

Open source gamified, configurable learning platform for schools, courses and more.

I am working on the backend of this project in **Go**.

## KebHub

iOS app for finding kebab shops in Bolzano.

This was developed for the "Fabrizio Rocca" contest in 2023, which I got 3rd place in!
